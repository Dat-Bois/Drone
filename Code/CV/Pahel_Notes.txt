erosions and dialations
import math for matrices
area.thresold eliminates all countors 1%
orig_frame = cv2.resize
interpolation = constant
Gaussian Blur removes distractions (5,5)
hsv works better in different lighting conditions because can set range of hues
hsv in range dark color to light
thresholds apply masks (mask, ?)
erosions take edge of whatevers left and erode it 
dialations make whats left larger/clearer
sorted() sorts countours to size (reverse = True constant) [:60] <--- play with that nuymber
bounding box = is constant
cv2.moments finds middle of all countorus
bounding box drawing is all the same
nms calculates where two boxes are overlapping and combines the two (play around with 0.1 (determines how much overlap mkae sthem same box))
width = orig_frame.shape[0]
height = orig_frame.shape[1]
need two masks since hsv goes to 315, 255, 255 (add masks)
convex-hole : able to detect bumps (in this case fingers) and make it convex
